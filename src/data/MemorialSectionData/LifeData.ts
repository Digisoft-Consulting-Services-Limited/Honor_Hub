      "content": "Heri Wonder was born on 29th January 2019, a beautiful soul who brought light and joy to everyone around her. From a young age, she was full of life—joyful, loving, caring, and friendly to all. She had a special gift of drawing people to her; in every new place she went, she pulled crowds with her infectious smile and boundless energy. Wonder was truly a wonder. \n\nHer presence was impossible to ignore—her warmth, her laughter, and her unfathomable aura made her a star in every room she entered. She excelled in everything she did, both in school and extracurricular activities. Her determination, intelligence, and kindness set her apart, making her not just a great student but also a beloved friend and classmate. \n\nOne of her most recent achievements was an award she received during the pet competition organized by St. John Ambulance. It was just another example of how she shined in everything she touched. \n\nBut on 23rd February 2025, our sweet Wonder left us too soon. We loved you, Wonder, but you were too big for this world. The world could not contain your greatness—it suffocated you instead. Our hearts ache with your absence, but we find peace in knowing you are now resting among the angels, shining even brighter. \n\nUntil we meet again, lovely.\nUntil we meet again, Donde.\nUntil we meet again, princess.\nUntil we meet again, baby girl.\nUntil we meet again. \n\nRest well, our sweet Wonder. You will forever be in our hearts."
