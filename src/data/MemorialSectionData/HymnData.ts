      "1. Blessed assurance, Jesus is mine!\nO what a foretaste of glory divine!\nHeir of salvation, purchase of God,\nBorn of His Spirit, washed in His blood.\n\nCHORUS:\nThis is my story, this is my song,\nPraising my Savior all the day long;\nThis is my story, this is my song,\nPraising my Savior all the day long.\n\n2. Perfect submission, perfect delight,\nVisions of rapture now burst on my sight;\nAngels descending bring from above\nEchoes of mercy, whispers of love.\n\n3. Perfect submission, all is at rest,\nI in my Savior am happy and blest;\nWatching and waiting, looking above,\nFilled with His goodness, lost in His love.\n\n",

      "1. There’s a land that is fairer than day,\nAnd by faith we can see it afar,\nFor the Father waits over the way\nTo prepare us a dwelling place there.\n\nCHORUS:\nIn the sweet by and by,\nWe shall meet on that beautiful shore;\nIn the sweet by and by,\nWe shall meet on that beautiful shore.\n\n2. We shall sing on that beautiful shore\nThe melodious songs of the blest,\nAnd our spirits shall sorrow no more;\nNot a sigh for the blessing of rest.\n\n3. To our bountiful Father above,\nWe will offer our tribute of praise,\nFor the glorious gift of His love,\nAnd the blessings that hallow our days."

        "1. Shall we gather at the river,\nWhere bright angel feet have trod,\nWith its crystal tide forever\nFlowing by the throne of God?\n\nCHORUS:\nYes, we’ll gather at the river,\nThe beautiful, the beautiful river;\nGather with the saints at the river\nThat flows by the throne of God.\n\n2. On the margin of the river,\nWashing up its silver spray,\nWe will walk and worship ever,\nAll the happy golden day.\n\n3. Ere we reach the shining river,\nLay we every burden down,\nGrace our spirits will deliver,\nAnd provide a robe and crown.\n\n4. Soon we’ll reach the shining river,\nSoon our pilgrimage will cease;\nSoon our happy hearts will quiver\nWith the melody of peace."

        "1. When peace, like a river, attendeth my way,\nWhen sorrows like sea billows roll,\nWhatever my lot, Thou hast taught me to say,\nIt is well, it is well with my soul.\n\nCHORUS:\nIt is well with my soul,\nIt is well, it is well with my soul.\n\n2. My sin—oh, the joy of this glorious thought—\nMy sin, not in part but the whole,\nIs nailed to the cross, and I bear it no more,\nPraise the Lord, praise the Lord, O my soul!\n\n3. And, Lord, haste the day when my faith shall be sight,\nThe clouds be rolled back as a scroll;\nThe trump shall resound, and the Lord shall descend,\nEven so, it is well with my soul."

Nearer, my God, to Thee,\nNearer to Thee!\nE’en though it be a cross\nThat raiseth me,\nStill all my song shall be,\nNearer, my God, to Thee;\nNearer, my God, to Thee;\nNearer to Thee!\n\n2. Though like the wanderer,\nThe sun gone down,\nDarkness be over me,\nMy rest a stone;\nYet in my dreams I’d be\nNearer, my God, to Thee;\nNearer, my God, to Thee;\nNearer to Thee!\n\n3. There let the way appear,\nSteps unto heaven;\nAll that Thou sendest me,\nIn mercy given;\nAngels to beckon me\nNearer, my God, to Thee;\nNearer, my God, to Thee;\nNearer to Thee!\n\n4. Then, with my waking thoughts\nBright with Thy praise,\nOut of my stony griefs\nBethel I’ll raise;\nSo by my woes to be\nNearer, my God, to Thee;\nNearer, my God, to Thee;\nNearer to Thee!\n\n5. Or if, on joyful wing\nCleaving the sky,\nSun, moon, and stars forgot,\nUpward I fly,\nStill all my song shall be,\nNearer, my God, to Thee;\nNearer, my God, to Thee;\nNearer to Thee!"

        "1. Jesus, keep me near the cross,\nThere a precious fountain,\nFree to all, a healing stream,\nFlows from Calvary’s mountain.\n\nCHORUS:\nIn the cross, in the cross,\nBe my glory ever,\nTill my raptured soul shall find\nRest beyond the river.\n\n2. Near the cross, a trembling soul,\nLove and mercy found me;\nThere the bright and morning star\nSheds its beams around me.\n\n3. Near the cross! O Lamb of God,\nBring its scenes before me;\nHelp me walk from day to day\nWith its shadow o’er me.\n\n4. Near the cross I’ll watch and wait,\nHoping, trusting ever,\nTill I reach the golden strand,\nJust beyond the river."

I need Thee every hour, stay Thou nearby;\nTemptations lose their power when Thou art nigh.\n\n3. I need Thee every hour, in joy or pain;\nCome quickly and abide, or life is vain.\n\n4. I need Thee every hour, teach me Thy will;\nAnd Thy rich promises in me fulfill."
