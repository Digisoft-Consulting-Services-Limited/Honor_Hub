        "Amazing grace! How sweet the sound\n  That saved a wretch like me!\n  I once was lost, but now am found;\n  Was blind, but now I see.\n’Twas grace that taught my heart to fear,\n  And grace my fears relieved;\n  How precious did that grace appear\n  The hour I first believed!\n  Through many dangers, toils, and snares,\n  I have already come;\n  ’Tis grace hath brought me safe thus far,\n  And grace will lead me home.\n  The Lord has promised good to me,\n  His Word my hope secures;\n  He will my Shield and Portion be,\n  As long as life endures.\n  When we’ve been there ten thousand years,\n  Bright shining as the sun,\n  We’ve no less days to sing God’s praise\n  Than when we’d first begun.",

        "O Lord my God, when I in awesome wonder\nConsider all the works Thy hands have made,\nI see the stars, I hear the rolling thunder,\nThy power throughout the universe displayed.\nThen sings my soul, my Saviour God, to Thee:\n  How great Thou art! How great Thou art!\n  Then sings my soul, my Saviour God, to Thee:\n  How great Thou art! How great Thou art!\n  When through the woods and forest glades I wander\n  And hear the birds sing sweetly in the trees;\n  When I look down from lofty mountain grandeur\n  And hear the brook and feel the gentle breeze:\n  And when I think that God, His Son not sparing,\n  Sent Him to die, I scarce can take it in;\n  That on the Cross, my burden gladly bearing,\n  He bled and died to take away my sin:\n  When Christ shall come with shout of acclamation\n  And take me home, what joy shall fill my heart!\n  Then I shall bow in humble adoration\nAnd there proclaim: My God, how great Thou art!\n",

      content:
        "When peace like a river attendeth my way,\nWhen sorrows like sea billows roll,\nWhatever my lot, Thou hast taught me to say,\nIt is well, it is well with my soul.\nThough Satan should buffet, though trials should come,\n  Let this blest assurance control:\n  That Christ hath regarded my helpless estate,\n  And hath shed His own blood for my soul.\n  My sin—oh, the bliss of this glorious thought!—\n  My sin, not in part but the whole,\n  Is nailed to the cross, and I bear it no more,\n  Praise the Lord, praise the Lord, O my soul!\n  And Lord, haste the day when the faith shall be sight,\n  The clouds be rolled back as a scroll;\n  The trump shall resound, and the Lord shall descend,\n  Even so, it is well with my soul!\n "
